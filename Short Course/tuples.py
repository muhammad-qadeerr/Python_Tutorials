# Lists are change_able but Tuple are not
# Tuples are defined in the parenthesis ()
# Parenthesis are not necessary

marks = (98, 97, 94, 95, 94, 94, 94)

#marks[1] = 89   # Can't change the value

# Operation that can be performed
# 1- Values can be counted

print(marks.count(94))

# 2- Index can be tested

print(marks.index(97))  # For repeated values only first index was printed
